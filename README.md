# LASAlle Air Logistics Lab

## Project Goals

The LASAlle 2.0 Linked List Library Lab aimed to achieve the following:

1. **Linked List Library Implementation:**
   - Develop a Linked List library adhering to LASA â€“ Air Logistic's coding standards.
   - Replace the array structure in LASAlle 1.1 with the newly created Linked List.

2. **Distance Module:**
   - Create a module that computes distances and returns a list of airports ordered by distance.
   - Utilize the Linked List library to facilitate efficient and flexible data handling.

## File Overview (main.cpp)

The `main.cpp` file contains the key functionalities:

- **Reading Data:**
  - Reads airport data from the "airport-codes_US.csv" file.

- **Linked List Population:**
  - Populates a Linked List with airport data.

- **Sorting:**
  - Sorts the Linked List based on the distance from Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.

- **Output:**
  - Prints information about the farthest airport from Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.
